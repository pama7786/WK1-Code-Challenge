#Introduction


This is week one code challenge of phase 1


##challenge1


This project is a student grade generator. It prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:
A &#62; 79, B - 60 to 79, C - 59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
To accomplish this, we can use the following steps:
1. Ask the user to input the student's mark.
2. Use an if-else statement to check the mark and output the correct grade.
3. Print the output to the console.


###challenge2

This project is a speed detector. It takes as input the speed of a car, and if the speed is less than 70, it prints "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.
For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: "Points: 2". If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended".
To accomplish this, we can use the following steps:
1. Ask the user to input the speed of the car.
2. Check if the speed is less than 70. If it is, print "Ok". Otherwise, continue to the next step.
3. For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), give the driver one demerit point.
4. Print the total number of demerit points.
5. If the driver gets more than 12 points, print "License suspended".

####challenge3

This project is a net salary calculator. It takes as input the basic salary and benefits, and calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
To accomplish this, we can use the following steps:
1. Ask the user to input their basic salary and benefits.
2. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax) using the KRA tax rates.
3. Calculate the NHIFDeductions using the NHIF rates.
4. Calculate the NSSFDeductions using the NSSF rates.
5. Calculate the gross salary by adding the basic salary and benefits.
6. Calculate the net salary by subtracting the payee, NHIFDeductions, and NSSFDeductions from the gross salary.
7. Print the results to the console.
