#Introduction


This is week one code challenge of phase 1


##challenge1


This project is a student grade generator. It prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:
A &#62; 79, B - 60 to 79, C - 59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
To accomplish this, we can use the following steps:
1. Ask the user to input the student's mark.
2. Use an if-else statement to check the mark and output the correct grade.
3. Print the output to the console.
